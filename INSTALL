Installation:
-------------

To build, first check that you have the packages required. The ones required 
to build are:

pkg-config
libgtk-3-dev
liblua5.3-dev
gettext

Then the build process is simple - to build the program, just type

make

which will in the end create an executable in the bin folder. If you want to
build an executable with debug symbols enabled, run

make DEBUG=1

To install the program run

make install

with super user priviliges, on a system using root:

su -c "make install"

or on a system using sudo, run

sudo make install

This will install the program in the system. This installs a desktop file too, 
so now you should have an icon in the development part of your X menu.

This will default to /usr/local, installing the executable to /usr/local/bin.
This can be changed using PREFIX variable:

	make install PREFIX=/usr
