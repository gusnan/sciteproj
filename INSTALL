Installation:
-------------

To build, first check that you have the packages required. The ones required 
to build are:

pkg-config
libgtk-3-dev

or if you are still using GTK version 2:

pkg-config
libgtk2.0-dev

Then the build process is simple - to build the program, just type

make

or on GTK2, you need to pass

make GTK2=1

which will in the end create an executable in the bin folder. If you want to
build an executable with debug symbols enable, run

make DEBUG=1

To install the program run

make install

with super user priviliges, on a system using root:

su -c "make install"

or on a system using sudo, run

sudo make install

This will install the program in the system. This installs a desktop file too, 
so now you should have an icon in the development part of your X menu.

This will default to /usr/local, installing the executable to /usr/local/bin.
This can be changed using PREFIX variable:

	make install PREFIX=/usr
